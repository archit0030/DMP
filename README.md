        Pick and pour
        
        Stacking tasks
        
        Other complex tasks

_Applications across industries:_

        Manufacturing
        
        Healthcare
        
        Agriculture
        
        Space operations

**Trajectory Generation**

        Essential for robot manipulation tasks.
        
        Involves planning and defining a path or trajectory for a robotic system.
        
        Ensures accurate movement of the robot's end-effector.
        
        Approaches to trajectory generation:
        
            Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP)

    
**Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP)**

        Breaks down complex movements into mathematical equations.
        
        Describes and governs movement trajectories.
        
        Generates smooth movement patterns for periodic and discrete movements.
        
        Can be learned by demonstration or programmed manually.

**Limitations of DMP**

        Struggles in unseen environments where learned trajectories are not directly applicable.
        
        Effectiveness depends on hyperparameter selection.
        
        Challenge in obtaining properly tuned DMP hyperparameters.

**Hyperparameter Selection**
        
        Crucial for generating trajectories with DMP.
        
        Using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach to find the best hyperparameter values.
        
        Ensures effective and efficient trajectory generation.

**Genetic Algorithm (GA)**
        
        An evolutionary algorithm inspired by genetics and natural selection.
        
        A robust tool for finding optimal or near-optimal solutions for complex problems.
        
        Enhances the ability to generate adaptive and precise movements in robotic systems when combined with DMP.
